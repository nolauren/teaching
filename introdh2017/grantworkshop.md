Here in your repository, write your answers to the following: 

(1) Formulate the humanities question(s) guiding the project. 

How did WWII and the Blitz change how Britons understood and experienced London?

  At the beginning of WWII, Britain and specifically London experienced great destruction and damage from German bombers in a 
in a lasting event known as the Blitz. From September 1940 to May 1941, Britain was under constant threat from German air fleets. I hope to research and create a project detailing how the events of the Blitz changed how Britons engaged with the city of London and how the damage and destruction redefined the space. I hope to see how the Blitz affected the understanding London in a way that is different from the period before the war. The methods used will be ArchGIS. 
The characterstics of a strong abstract:

- explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
- includes the DH methods that will be used and why
- identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in
