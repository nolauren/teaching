<span>**Course Description:**</span>


The course will focus on the relation between activism and media in the 1960s.  

Throughout the 1960s, the US engaged in confrontations at home and abroad. 
Activists in the African American Civil Rights Movement made mass participation in bus boycotts,
freedom rides, lunch counter sit-ins, and voter registration central to their campaigns for racial justice.
The Black Panther Party agitated for community control and support through local policing and social services, 
serving as a model for grassroots liberation movements across the country. 
War On Poverty legislation called for "maximum feasible participation" by the poor in community action programs
to eliminate poverty.  Activists in the white student-led "New Left" mobilized around the concept 
of "participatory democracy," which for them meant direct in political transformation, 
and organized protests against the Vietnam War.  In all of these cases, activists turned to a variety of 
cultural forms - the underground press, film, photography, and TV -  to build their communities, 
highlight social injustice, and argue for social change. Expression on their terms mattered and 
was grounded in the belief that how a group of people was culturally incorporated into the nation 
shaped their cultural, political, and social inclusion.  We will specifically explore how African Americans
and white youth in the New Left organized for social change through media.  

The course will focus on five questions:

1.	How and why did Americans use media to create and respond to rapid cultural, social, and political change in the 1960s?
2.	How did corporate media including Hollywood and the major networks represent activism?
3.	How did activists represent themselves and for what ends?
4.	How do we interpret different kinds of media as scholarly evidence?
5.	How can we use the digital humanities to ask and answer questions in the humanities?

Texts will focus on corporate media from Hollywood and documentary film such as the work of Newsreel,
photography from the civil rights movement, and publications from the underground press. 
Methodologies used in the course include visual analysis, close textual analysis, and digital humanities.

<Assignments>

In Class Presentation and Discussion: Each week, a group will present on a piece of media. 
The group will use the Underground/Alternative Press Database to find an article, 
image or drawing that relates to the week’s topic, close read their selection,
and discuss how it relates to the week’s readings.  The group will write a blog post (500 words), 
present their argument in class, and lead discussion. 

Collaborative Timeline: As a class, we will build a timeline of major events during the 1960s. Each class, pick an event to add to our timeline. Intructions for adding an event will be provided.

- Paper 1: Close analysis of a photograph. (1500 words) Instructions and rubric discussed in class. 

- Paper 2: Close analysis of a film. (1500 words) Instructions and rubric discussed in class. 

- Mapping the Alternative Press Final Assignment:
The class will work together to develop a map of the underground press during the 1960s.
We will discuss how to structure humanities data, develop a database, and create maps during class. 
Each student will focus on an underground press publication.
They will write a description (1500 words) that: (a) contextualizes the publication within the 1960s;
(b) addresses the major themes of the publication;
(c) and highlights an article or image that is representative of the publication.  
Their descriptions will be integrated into the underground press map. 
Each student will present their publication at the end of the semester. 




<span>**Late Work:**</span>
Late work receives a letter grade deduction for each class
period it is late. 

<span>**Academic Integrity:**</span>
Students are expected to pledge the following statement on all
assignments turned in for credit, including exams, papers and laboratory
reports: "I pledge that I have neither received nor given unauthorized
assistance during the completion of this work.” Academic honesty
is—defined broadly and simply—the performance of all academic work
without cheating, lying, stealing, or receiving assistance from any
other person or using any source of information not appropriately
authorized or attributed. The University of Richmond and I personally
take academic honesty very seriously. All students are responsible for
maintaining the highest standards of honesty and integrity in every
phase of their academic careers. The penalties for academic dishonesty
are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense. For more

<span>**Attendance:**</span>
Students are responsible for all information in the class, regardless of their personal attendance. 
If a student is absent, it is their responsibility to inquire about what they have missed.
Absences due to university activities (e.g., sports, debate, etc.) must be discussed with the 
instructor before the relevant class period(s). An official notice must be shown to the instructor. 
Arrangements concerning absences are entirely at the instructor’s discretion. 
Absences, unless for documented illness, emergency, or university business, will result in a loss 
of participation points. More than 5 absences may result in an “F” for the semester.
