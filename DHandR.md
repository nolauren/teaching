  <span>**Instructor:**</span>   <span>**Dr. Lauren Tilton**</span>


  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------

<span>**Course Description:**</span>
 In this graduate course, we will explore applying computational image analysis with R. By the end of the semester, we will:
 
-   Understand the core concepts and methods of image analysis

-   Become familiar with the programming language R

-   Understand how to apply image analysis to answer humanities scholarly questions

-   Learn how to work collaboratively in the humanities

The course will culminate in a final project. No prior programming experience expected or required.  

<span>**Assignment:**</span>
 The final paper will apply image analysis to a corpus. Three data sets wil be provided:
 - WikiMedia Commons
 - Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information Photography Collection
 - Network Era Sitcoms Stills Collection
 You may also choose to work with your own corpus. More details about the paper will be discussed in class.
