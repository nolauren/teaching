<span>**Course Description:**</span>
Digital Humanities or “DH” brings the application of computing to
humanities questions. In this course, we will explore applying
computational methods with R.

 By the end of the course, we will:

-   Become familiar with the core concepts and methods of image analysis  

-   Understand how to apply image analysis to answer scholarly questions

-   Learn how to work collaboratively in the humanities

The course will culminate in a final project.
*No prior programming experience expected or required.*
