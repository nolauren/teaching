<span>**Course Description:**</span>
Digital Humanities or “DH” brings the application of computing to
humanities questions. In this course, we will explore applying
computational image analysis with R.

 By the end of the course, we will:
 
-   Become familiar with the programming language R

-   Understand the core concepts and methods of image analysis  

-   Understand how to apply image analysis to answer scholarly questions

-   Learn how to work collaboratively in the humanities

The course will culminate in a final project.
*No prior programming experience expected or required.*

<span>**Grading:**</span>

-   20% Participation

-   30% 

-   50% Final Project
 


<span>**Readings:**</span>
Most of the readings in this course consist of journal articles, blog
posts, and chapters from edited volumes. These will all be available
digitally, for free, from the course website (some may require you to be
behind the University of Richmond firewall).
