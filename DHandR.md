<span>**Course Description:**</span>
Digital Humanities or “DH” brings the application of computing to
humanities questions. In this course, we will explore applying
computational methods with R.

 By the end of the course, we will:

-   Become familiar with the core concepts and methods of DH

-   Understand how to apply DH methods to answer scholarly questions

-   Articulate the stakes of DH scholarship

-   Learn how to work collaboratively in the humanities

The course will culminate in a final project.
*No prior programming experience expected or required.*

<span>**Grading:**</span>

-   20% Participation

-   30% Short Projects (10% each. Rubric will be provided.)

-   50% Final Project

<span>**Late Work:**</span>
Turning in late work reflects poorly on you. Please avoid it at all
costs. Any late work receives a letter grade deduction for each class
period it is late.
 


<span>**Readings:**</span>
Most of the readings in this course consist of journal articles, blog
posts, and chapters from edited volumes. These will all be available
digitally, for free, from the course website (some may require you to be
behind the University of Richmond firewall).
