# Digital History Toolbox
American Historical Association 2017 |  Colorado Convention Center Room 205  

This session is an all-encompassing look at incorporating entry-level tools 
for text mining, mapping and timelines into your teaching or research for the first time. 
We’ll use three web-based tools (Storymap.js, Voyant and Timeline.js) and give you a common
dataset to work from. Along the way, we’ll also give you a few tips on how to get your own
data in shape. Preparation: Please bring an Internet-equipped laptop.




## Voyant 

The State of the Union is delivered by the President of the United States annualy to a joint session of Congress. 
It is often a space where the President reflects on current issues and outlines goals for the nation. Therefore, it is
a key document for understanding the ways the executive branch understands the current position of the country and 
their priorities. While today it is delivered oraly by the President, the State of the Union was initially a written document 
submitted to congress. In this workshop, we will:

- Identify issues and priorities overtime
- Compare and contrast written vs oral addresses


In order to analyze our texts, we will do several kinds of text analysis:

- Word Counts : Frequency, Unique, Total
 


We will be using Voyant:  a web-based text reading and analysis environment.

According to the Voyant Website <sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, we can do the folllowing:

- Use it to learn how computers-assisted analysis works. Check out our examples that show you how to do real academic tasks with Voyant.
- Use it to study texts that you find on the web or texts that you have carefully edited and have on your computer.
- Use it to add functionality to your online collections, journals, blogs or web sites so others can see through your texts with analytical tools.
- Use it to add interactive evidence to your essays that you publish online. Add interactive panels right into your research essays (if they can be published online) so your readers can recapitulate your results.
- Use it to develop your own tools using our functionality and code.
