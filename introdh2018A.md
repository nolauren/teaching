## Course Description: 
Digital Humanities or “DH” brings the application of computing to
humanities questions. In this course, we will explore applying
computational methods including text analysis, mapping, and network
analysis to humanities data. Our guiding questions include:


-   Why and how to apply computational methods to the humanities?

-   Which methods are best for which forms of inquiry?

-   What forms and kinds of scholarly inquiry are made possible?

-   What are the challenges and limitations of DH?

We will address these questions while learning
different methods. Generally, the first half of class will be
dedicated to discussing the readings, and the second half will be a lab
where we will apply the methods. By the end of the course, we will be able to:

-    Identify and apply a set of DH methods 
-    Articulate the possibilities and limits of a set of DH methods 
-    Understand how  DH can help pose and answer scholarly questions
-    Develop strategies for working collaboratively in the humanities

The course will culminate in a final project.
*No prior programming experience expected or required.*

## Evaluation

|% of Grade | Type| 
|----------|------| 
| 20% | Participation and Attendance | 
| 40% | Four Short Assignments (10% each) | 
| 40%  | Final Project (5% Presentation, 35% Grant)| 

### Participation & Attendance:

- Participation. Students will be assessed on the basis of "quality" participation, which entails active engagement in class and undivided attention. Each class, we will walk through the questions Weekly Discussion Questions section at the end of this syllabus.  To facilitate an undistracted environment, no laptops, cell phones, iPhones, etc. will be permitted only during labs unless I indicate otherwise. If you are caught using one of these devices during class time, your class participation grade will be adversely affected. If you feel strongly about using a laptop in class, please see me to discuss. 

| Grade | Expectations | 
|------|---------|
| A | Student demonstrates superior preparation for class; draws connections between readings and other course materials; shows excellent critical thinking skills; contributes significantly to discussion, elevates the level of discussion; comments in a thoughtful manner | 
| B | Student demonstrates solid preparation for class; offers analyses of texts; contributes to the advancement of discussion; student is consistently involved; shows a willingness to challenge ideas and concepts| 
| C  | Student shows basic preparation but is sporadically involved in class discussion; shows some critical engagement with course concepts; participates infrequently | 
| D  | Student is present but is not involved in class discussion; shows little engagement with course materials | 
| F  | Student has missed more than three classes; attendance is a consistent problem; makes no effort to communicate with professor| 

### Attendance: 

Students are expected to be in class on time.  However, merely showing up for class does not guarantee "A" participation. See below for class participation assessment guidelines. Students are permitted one (1) unexcused absence over the course of the semester. Additional absences will result in a class participation grade penalty of .3 points/class, unless valid documentation is provided within one week of the absence. If a student is absent, it is their responsibility to inquire about what they have missed. Absences due to university activities (e.g., sports, debate, etc.) must be discussed with the instructor before the relevant class period(s). An official notice must be shown to the instructor. Arrangements concerning absences are entirely at the instructor’s discretion. Absences, unless for documented illness, emergency, or university business, will result in a loss of participation points.  More than three absences will constitute grounds for failing this course. If you are absent on a given day, it is your responsibility to catch up on any work you miss. To support this process, the class will be divided into groups of 3. Whenever you miss class, you should get notes from another student. Note sharing is encouraged. Write down the contact information for three other students who you can email/text/call to get a copy of their notes should you miss a class:

| Name | Email | Phone |
|------|--------|----|
|                 |                 |                 |
|                 |                 |                 |
|                 |                 |                 |
 

 I am more than happy to answer questions regarding course materials, however, it is your responsibility to be in touch with me.

### Grades:

Grades will be given on a 4.0 scale.

- Grade Updates: I am happy to speak with you at any point in the semester to discuss your progress in the course. I am available during office hours as well as by appointment.
- Grade Complaints: Should you wish to challenge a grade,I require that you email me within one week of receiving your grade to set up a meeting to discuss. I will not entertain grade complaints via email.
- Late Work: Late work receives a 1/3 of a grade deduction [ex. 3.7 (A-) to a 3.3 (B+)] for each day it is late. You’ve almost make is through this syllabus. If you’ve read this by September 7, email me your favorite meme and you will receive an extra day to turn in an assignment if you need it.

### Student Accommodations: 

I would like to hear from anyone who has a disability or a special challenge that requires some modification of seating or other class requirements so that we can make appropriate arrangements. Please see me after class or during office hours.

### Academic Integrity:  

Students are expected to pledge the following statement on all assignments turned in for credit, including exams, papers and laboratory reports: "I pledge that I have neither received nor given unauthorized assistance during the completion of this work.” Academic honesty is—defined broadly and simply—the performance of all academic work without cheating, lying, stealing, or receiving assistance from any other person or using any source of information not appropriately authorized or attributed. The University of Richmond and I personally take academic honesty very seriously. All students are responsible for maintaining the highest standards of honesty and integrity in every phase of their academic careers. The penalties for academic dishonesty are severe and ignorance is not an acceptable defense. For more information on URʼs commitment to building intellectual integrity, visit: [http://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/the-honor-code.html](http://studentdevelopment.richmond.edu/student-handbook/honor/the-honor-code.html)



###  Academic Support

The Writing Center (http://writing.richmond.edu or (804) 289-8263) assists writers at all levels of experience, across all majors. Students can schedule appointments with trained writing con- sultants who offer friendly critiques of written work.

Violence and harassment do exist on college campuses, including here. If you experience violence of any nature or are suffering in any other way, you are encouraged to turn to the offices below to get the support and protection you need. Please also remember that Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are civil rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc.

The University of Richmond is committed to providing maximum support for all students who have experienced sexual or other violence and strongly encourages students to report any incident. All college services are available to those who have experienced violence, regardless of whether or not a student intends to file a formal complaint. If you or someone you know has been harassed or assaulted – sexually or otherwise – the campus community has structures in place to support its students.
